# Linear Regression - Machine Learning Lab 2

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the Machine Learning Lab 2 assignment on Linear Regression.

## Introduction

In this lab assignment, we explore the concept of linear regression, a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics. Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## Jupyter Notebook

The primary content of this repository is the Jupyter Notebook, [lab2_linear_regression.ipynb](lab2_linear_regression.ipynb). This notebook covers the following topics:

1. Linear Regression Basics: An introduction to linear regression and its assumptions.
2. House Price Prediction: An example of linear regression for predicting house prices based on square footage.
3. Cosine Fitting: An example of fitting a cosine function to synthetic data.
4. Code Implementation: Code cells demonstrating data generation, model fitting, and visualization.

## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need the following:

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook to open and run the notebook.

You can open and run the notebook by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```


## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook, `lab2_linear_regression.ipynb`, in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run the notebook cells one by one to explore the concepts and examples.
3. Modify the code as needed for your own experiments and learning.
